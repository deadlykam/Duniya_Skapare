## Prerequisites
#### Godot Game Engine
Godot version **v4.1.3.stable.mono.official [f06b6836a]** and above should work. Previous Godot 4 versions should work but those have not been tested.
***
## Stable Build
[Stable-v1.0.0](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare/tree/Stable-v1.0.0) is the latest stable build of the project. The compressed file for this project can also be found there. If development is going to be done on this project then it is adviced to branch off of any _Stable_ branches because they will **NOT** be changed or updated except for README.md. Any other branches are subjected to change including the main branch.
***
## Installation
1. First download the latest [Duniya_Skapare-v1.0.0.zip](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare/releases/tag/v1.0.0) from the latest Stable build.
2. Once downloaded extract/unzip the file.
3. Enter the folder and copy the folder named **kamran_wali**.
4. Now paste the folder in the **addons** folder of your Godot project. If your Godot project does not have the **addons** folder then just create it in the root folder, **res://**, and paste the copied folder there.
5. (Optional) To open the interface for Duniya_Skapare simply go to the menu _Project_ -> _Projct Settings_. Click the _Plugins_ tab and enable the **DS Wave Function Collapse**. This should open and dock the **DS Wave Function Collapse**.

## Features
### Wave Function Collapse:
Let me give a brief explanation of Wave Function Collapse. Wave Function Collapse or WFC is a constraint based algorithm that can be used to procedurally generate anything from images to 2D or 3D worlds. Basically that means the algorithm uses a set of rules to generate the desired result. In this tool we are going to use WFC to generate 2D or 3D worlds.

See [Wave Function Collapse Tool](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare/wiki/Wave-Function-Collapse-Tool) and [Wiki](https://github.com/deadlykam/Duniya_Skapare/wiki) documentations to understand how to use the tool. It is very simple to use and soon I will be making a tutorial on how to use the tool.

## Duniya Skapare Meaning:
The meaning of _Duniya Skapare_ is _World Creator_. [Duniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunya#:~:text=%22Dunya%22%20is%20an%20Arabic%20word,%2C%20this%20world%20here%20below%22.) means _World_ in Arabic/Bengali. [Skapare](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/swedish-english/skapare) means _Creator_ in Swedish. As I speak the mentioned languages I thought about merging them to give a unique name.
